I was vaguely aware of all the meth heads and dealers in the room watching me fall apart. ‚ÄúGive her a shot,‚Äù I heard Chulengo say to someone. I didn‚Äôt know whom he was talking to or what he was talking about, and before I even tried to figure it out, a strange man kneeled on the ground next to me. He grabbed my arm and told me to try to relax. I lay there lifeless, watching him and not knowing my life was getting ready to take a turn for the worst. He tightened a belt around my upper arm and closed my fist. I felt his fingers sliding up and down my arm. He pierced my skin with a sharp needle, and I saw my blood squirt back into the tube,

Title: Heart wrenching story!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2020
Review: Today I finished reading One Woman‚Äôs Journey: Surviving The Streets by Brittnay Dodd Santiago. For those of you that don‚Äôt know who Brittnay is, she‚Äôs a cast member on the reality tv show Love After Lock-up.
‚†Ä
Brittnay‚Äôs story reminded me a lot of Cyntoia Brown‚Äôs story from the book Free Cyntoia. These women share a lot in common as young girls caught up in the street life, abused, manipulated and raped by older men that both of these girls thought loved them. Today this kind of sexual abuse is known as child sex trafficking.
‚†Ä
Brittnay went through sooooo much in her youth. From the neglect she experienced by on her parents to battling a horrible meth addiction, it was all very heart wrenching to read.
‚†Ä
This book only goes up to her first 17years of life. I wasn‚Äôt too happy about that because I wanted to know what happened leading up to her being on television. I guess that will be in the next book. Or maybe even the third book being that she states this is the first book in a trilogy. Honestly, I‚Äôm not sure if I will read the other two books.
‚†Ä
I theme that is reoccurring throughout the book is addiction...addiction to drugs, alcohol, gambling and sex.
‚†Ä
There were moments I was extremely frustrated with Brittnay and I wanted to yell at her. Then there were moments I want to save her, hug her.
‚†Ä
It‚Äôs so good to know that today she is living happily with her husband and three children. Knowing that her life has completely changed for the better made it easier for me to digest the book.
‚†Ä
Overall I give it 3/5‚≠êÔ∏ès. Although the story is heartbreaking, I think the entire story could have been told in one book. There‚Äôs no need to drag it out. Also, there are no page numbers (which annoys me), and the print on each page only goes about three quarters of the way down the page, which makes for a lot of empty space.

Review: This book is heart breaking... powerful and such an eye opener. I lived a similar life that young and its absolutely amazing to read in the mind of another amazing person to fight through horrible struggles no child should ever go through. YOU ARE AMAZING STRONG AND A TRUE INSPIRATION.
If you haven't read this you really should. Grabs some tissues this is a real life journey
This for sure a 5 star read!

Title: Soul Crushing
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2020
Review: I have watched Britrany on Love after Lockup. She is always positive and REAL! When I heard about her book, i had to read it ASAP. I now understand why Brittany is the fierce Mom and wife she is today. My heart ached, and broke for her NUMEROUS times while reading her story. She was failed so many times by so many people. Addiction is no joke! I could not put my kindle down. Have some tissues ready. I look forward to reading the next book in the trilogy. Brittany Dodd-Santiago is a SURVIVOR!

Title: Very Good Read, Truthful story about addiction
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2020
Review: I thought this book was very well written. I‚Äôm bummed the book stops but in a way I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not over. This is a classic tale of a child of an alcoholics life and how fast the cycle repeats itself.

Title: PAGE TURNER FOR SURE!!!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2021
Review: What a brave young girl, who practically becomes a woman before she's ready or ought to...
...I just couldn't stop reading at times, especially towards the end...at that point, I practically read it straight through! This woman is a true example of a survivor! Please if you are reading this review; stop now & go read her story that she has to tell the world! It is amazing of what she has prevailed though, all of the hardships she endured, && most definitely how she just kept on going, even when she felt like she was falling apart to say the least!
